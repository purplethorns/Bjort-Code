## Start
> _Now that I'm here_, what do I do?

First, check that you've done these things:

* Check classroom, or the resource library.
* Cloned the repository using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).
* Added it as a project on [Android Studio](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/ftc/android-studio-tutorial.pdf).

Next, open up the folder called _ftc_app-3.5_, and you will find further instructions in there. 

Now you can start coding!

## FAQ
> I'm having trouble finding _where_ the code is! 

Try this directory:
`ftc_app-3.5\TeamCode\src\main\java\org\firstinspires\ftc\teamcode`
This is where the majority of our coding work takes place. Then take a look at the readme file.

> I'm finished with my work, how do I get it to update on GitHub?

Push your commits to origin by clicking the buttons along the top of the Github desktop application.
